                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>New York City has been deemed as a land of opportunity and adventure for ages. The lifestyle is
                    fast, booming,
                    and often unpredictable. While we can’t solve all of New York City’s mysteries, we have cracked one
                    of the
                    largest of them all- housing. Roomi takes the guesswork out of searching for a roommate by using
                    fine-tuned
                    algorythyms to match you with the roommate of your dreams. We aim to create a safe and sound
                    environment for
                    young professionals to fulfill their roommate and housing needs without having to worry about their
                    security.
                    Roomi allows you to life your life without having to stress about the where and how.</p>

                <p>Our app allows you to rate past roommates and apartments in order to keep a record of our users’
                    history. What does this mean? This holds all of our apartment seekers and landlords accountable to
                    providing an easy, comfortable and painless renting experience.</p>

                    with our in-app rent payment feature that allows you to send your rent directly to your landlord.
                    In order to ensure security, all of our landlords are required to pass a background check and well

                <h1>Design Process</h1>
                <p>In order to create a design that addressed the needs of our users, we first asked questions to find
                    where existing platforms in the market were lacking, define our user and brand, and discover how
                    our design could provide a solution. <br><br>We found that the services that offer aid in finding a
                    roommate and apartment lack the customization, security and simplicity that our users desire. In
                    order to address these issues, we created a persona of our ideal consumer and followed their journey of finding an apartment in New York City.
                    <br><br>Our key findings in our emotional mappings were that our users need a safe, secure and
                    reliable living situation, an apartment that fit their budget, and a place that fits within their
                    desired timeframe and location. This allowed us to expand the existing Roomi app to create an all-in-one platform
                    for all roommate and housing needs.
                    <br><br>We followed the previous format of Roomi’s existing platform that balanced copy with
                    illustration in order to create an engaging interface. We chose to build off their character
                    illustrations to maintain the playful and personal vibe of the brand. 
                    <br><br>Finally, we tested our design with five qualified users in order to receive feedback on their user experience and found that the features that excited them most were the ability to make payments through the app as well as our rating system.</p>
